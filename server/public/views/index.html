                <p>"Hello world, this is me, life should be oh oh yeah, fun for every one." <br>I like making my life entertaining, which is why i have picked up so many hobbies along the way. i was raised half my life in ST. Louis and the other half in St Paul. I am an amateur Woodworker, Silversmith and Blacksmith. i enjoy dancing, power kiting and rock climbing. I am presently studying to become a programmer, but until then, I have pretty things to sell.</p>

                <h3>MY JEWELRY</h3>
                <p>when I was in high school I developed an interest in working with metal. When I entered college my only option for this outlet was a jewelry making class and I loved it. where else do you get to create art, use power tools, melt metal, and play with fire that burns with the heat of a thousand suns? I basically scratch away at wax or twist around metal until i start to see something pretty, then I follow where the creation naturally flows until it's finished. In short, here’s a part of my gallery.</p>

                <h3>Hoard or Die</h3>
                <p>Hoard or Die, is a twenty minute, 3-5 player game that pits players against each other in a free for all race to become the richest lord in the land. Raid the king's hoard for riches, and strike down any noble house that tries to do the same. Command your army of five unique dice, specialized in attacking, pilfering, and defending. Then summon the red drake to roast the competition... Oh did i not mention the dragon? Yes, fire breathing, money grubbing dragons will offer up their services to any lord for a nominal fee. So summon your greatest warriors, defend your lords and become the next king of the realm. The game play is fast paced, and the tensions are high, because in this kingdom, it is Hoard or Die.</p>

                <h3>The Islands <span>(working title)</span></h3>
                <p>The Islands is a quick 45 minute game, for 2-5 players. each player is the ruler of a small island, that has yet to begin development. Though non-violent in nature, each ruler has a fierce desire for their home to become more developed than the rest. each step in development will grant the ruler greater prestige than the last. but because the islands are incredibly limited in resources decisions must be made carefully, because when they have run out, there will be no means of replenishment. so trade, demand, harvest, and clearcut your way to victory because at the end of the game there will be tea, and wouldn’t you like to humble brag over tea?</p>
